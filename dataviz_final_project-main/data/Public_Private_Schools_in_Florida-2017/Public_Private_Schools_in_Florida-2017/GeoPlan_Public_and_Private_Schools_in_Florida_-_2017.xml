            <abstract>This dataset contains 2017 Private and Public School Information for the State of Florida. It is a combination of schools and educational facility addresses from various sources, including the Florida Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, and other sources listed below. The data contains selected fields denoting the physical address, school number, district, and contact information for schools located in Florida. This data is meant to be used for planning purposes only and is not intended to represent a 100% inventory of schools. School locations that have been verified are marked with the letter V in the FLAG field. This dataset is an update to the GC_SCHOOLS_MAY12 layer. This layer corresponds to the schools boundary layer GC_SCHOOLSBND_SEP17 available through FGDL.</abstract>
            <purpose>The data was created to serve as base information for use in GIS systems for a variety of planning and analytical purposes.</purpose>
            <supplinf>Master School Identification File Background and Use The Master School Identification (MSID) file is maintained by the Department of Education (DOE) to ensure the Department provides accurate identification and directory information on each Florida public school in the state. This file contains information for all public PK-12 schools as well as for adult and vocational-technical schools operated by district school boards. Information from this file is used for direct communication to the schools as well as for reporting data for each school. The Master School Identification file is used to edit all records submitted to the Department's Student, Staff and Finance Automated Data Base Systems. The MSID provides the universe for accountability reporting, including annual school grades and adequate yearly progress calculations. It is the basis for reporting to the U.S. Department of Education (USDE) via the Common Core of Data and Education Data Exchange Network (EDEN) reporting systems. The federally-assigned identification numbers, which are required for certain grant applications and for assignment of E-rate funds, are provided to the Florida DOE the year following submission of new school information to the USDE. Accessing the File Appendix A provides a list of the elements contained in the Master School Identification file. MSID information for each Florida public school is available on the web at: http://doeweb-prd.doe.state.fl.us/EDS/MasterSchoolID. The data are presented in three sections: 1) addresses, 2) administration and 3) accountability. Three ways are provided for the user to look up a school: 1) by the school name, 2) by the district in which the school is located and 3) by the city/town in which the school is located. School Type School Type is an indication of the level of instruction offered at the school. The School Type is derived directly from the Grade Code reported for the school. Elementary Schools: Schools providing instruction at one or more grade levels from PK through grade 5. May include schools serving grade 6 if also serving one or more grades PK through 5 (e.g., a K-6 school). Middle/Junior High Schools: Schools providing instruction in middle school configurations (grades 6-8) and junior high school configurations (grades 7-9). Can also include schools serving a single grade in the 6-8 range (e.g., a 6th grade center). Senior High Schools: Schools providing instruction at one or more grade levels from 9 to 12. Includes regular high schools and 9th grade centers. Combination Elementary and Secondary Schools: Schools providing instruction in grade groupings that include more than one of the categories described above (e.g., PK-8, 6-12, K-12, etc.). Adult Schools: Schools providing adult education instruction. FDOE Public Schools are from the Master School ID file, Public schools are from the 2016-2017 school year. http://doeweb-prd.doe.state.fl.us/EDS/MasterSchoolID FDOE K-12 Private Schools are from the Florida Department of Education K-12 Private Schools Annual Survey, Private schools are from the 2014-2015 school year. http://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/information/PrivateSchoolDirectory/Default.aspx **************************************************** The Common Core of Data (CCD) is a program of the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics that annually collects fiscal and non-fiscal data about all public schools, public school districts and state education agencies in the United States. The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include information that describes schools and school districts, including name, address, and phone number; descriptive information about students and staff, including demographics; and fiscal data, including revenues and current expenditures. http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/address.asp NCES public school data is gathered by CCD (Common Core of Data), Public school data is from the 2014-2015 school year http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/ NCES private school data is gathered by PSS (Private School Universe Survey), Private school data is from the 2013-2014 school year.

        <useconst>The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources) who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist. Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using, modifying, contributing or distributing the materials. A note about data scale: Scale is an important factor in data usage. Certain scale datasets are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes. Please be sure you are using the best available data. 1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the county level. 1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such as property parcel boundaries. 1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the multi-county or regional level. 1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the regional or state level or larger. Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact section of this documentation. For more information regarding scale and accuracy, see our webpage at: http://geoplan.ufl.edu/education.html</useconst>

                <procdesc>The GeoPlan Center performed the following steps in order to create the 2008 statewide schools data layer. 68 Different Sources Comprise the Schools Dataset. The following Sources were either reprojected to the FGDL Albers NAD83 HPGN map projection or if no spatial data existed they were geocoded to a statewide 2007 TeleAtlas Streets dataset. For downloaded county and district wide polygon layers the label points were created and then used for each facility. Once the point sources were created via geocoding or reprojected existing point data they were merged into one statewide layer. Record (facility) duplications were removed by manually viewing and editing the statewide layer's attribute table for each of the 67 counties. Where record duplication existed source information of previously corrected FDOT Districts and Regional Planning Council data took preference followed by, County data, and finally geocoded data. Finally the FDOE state identification number and the NCES federal identification numbers were added for each facility with such an id. Next a table join was performed for each table (FDOE and NCES) to the master statewide shapefile. Un-used or duplicate fields were deleted. Below are the data Sources as described in the Source field in the attribute table.</procdesc>

In most cases, school locations were checked using imagery and Google Street View and either marked as Verified or Not Verified in the FLAG field, please see the FLAG field Attribute Definition for more information. During the Spatial and Tabular QAQC duplicates and non-qualified points were removed. The final Point layer was spatially joined to a 2015 statewide parcel layer, and the GCID field was populated with a crosswalk ID linking each point feature with it's corresponding polygon layer feature, GC_SCHOOLSBND_SEP17. The GCID field replaces the SCHOOL_ID field of the previous gc_schools layer as the unique crosswalk ID. Finally, the GeoPlan Center performed the following attribute table adjustments: Populated and cleaned all fields. Fields added include: -GCID: replaces SCHOOLID as unique ID field -FSOURCE -DATASOURCE: replaces SOURCE -MGRS: replaces USNG_FL_1K field Fields removed include: - COMMON_USE - USE - ACTIVITY School services/programs from new datasets above that were located at county school district offices (for example:county student services, migrant programs, virtual programs, Mckay scholarship programs, homebound programs, etc.) were not added in order to avoid duplicate points at county school district locations.

        <resdesc>DOWNLOADABLE DATA</resdesc>
        <distliab>The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources) who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist. Furthermore, the GIS data available in the FGDL are provided 'as is'. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no warranties, guaranties or representations as to the truth, accuracy or completeness of the data provided by the data sources. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no representations or warranties about the quality or suitability of the materials, either expressly or implied, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The University of Florida GeoPlan Center shall not be liable for any damages suffered as a result of using, modifying, contributing or distributing the materials. A note about data scale: Scale is an important factor in data usage. Certain scale datasets are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes. Please be sure you are using the best available data. 1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the county level. 1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such as property parcel boundaries. 1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the multi-county or regional level. 1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the regional or state level or larger. Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact section of this documentation. For more information regarding scale and accuracy, see our webpage at: http://geoplan.ufl.edu/education.html</distliab>
